🧠 How It Works
On component mount, a random room name is generated (CallNexus-abc123 style).

Users can also manually enter or share a room name.

The Jitsi meeting component renders a full iframe-based video call.

Calls start with muted mic & camera.

Watermarks, logos, lobby mode, and third-party distractions are removed for a clean experience.
